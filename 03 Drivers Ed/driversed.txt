DriversEd.c activities

1. Modify the program to get the robot to drive forward for 1 second.
2. Now try 5 seconds.
3. Comment out the msleep line (this is best practice when you want to remove a line of code instead of deleting it). What happens? What role does msleep play in the program? Uncomment the msleep line before moving on.
4. Change both motor lines of code to 100 power. How is it different from 50 power? What about 25 power? How could you measure and quantify the differences?
6. Change one of the motors to 60 power. What happens? How would this configuration be useful?
7. The ao() function turns all motors off. How would you turn one of the motors off?
8. Change both motor settings to -50 power. What happens? 
9. Modify the program to cause the robot to do the following:
a. Go forward at 50% power to the black line.
b. Turn left 90 degrees.
c. Go forward at 50% to the end of the black line.
